A one-hit wonder with a horrible rep for cancelling shows and copping an attitude, Jason isn't what Beth's mother, Eileen, considers a reliable musical act for the beloved festival, which she is proudly hosting with her good friend Ruth. Beth, reigning as Strawberry Queen, attempts to stick up for her favorite singer, but when she finally meets Jason face-to-face, it becomes obvious it won't be easy. But behind Jason's rock star image, he's hiding a secret about his past that could turn his tanking career around. Along with his manager Ray, Beth convinces Jason the festival gig is a great way to revitalize his career and win back his audience appeal. As Jason spends more time with Beth, his attitude starts to fade as they each encourage the other to realize their deepest dreams as talented musicians.", "popularity": 4.458, "poster_path": "/pOg6AIP2SGXds4aykLAuMjqBIFU.jpg", "release_date": "2012-08-25", "title": "Strawberry Summer", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.5, "vote_count": 22}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/2AyORI4K6wTo6EDs0FlLzNUqMHP.jpg", "genre_ids": [18, 36, 10770], "id": 36465, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Into the Storm", "overview": "This powerful follow-up to \u201cThe Gathering Storm\u201d follows Churchill from 1940 to 1945 as he guided his beleaguered nation through the crucible of the war years--even as his marriage was encountering its own struggles.", "popularity": 8.216, "poster_path": "/icIs3OmlazNg6LpfJmGGlw5VTiy.jpg", "release_date": "2009-05-31", "title": "Into the Storm", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.6, "vote_count": 64}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/q3oxb8KBBc3XvIsQjtLwYIGEFmR.jpg", "genre_ids": [35, 10402, 12], "id": 31805, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Road to Morocco", "overview": "Two carefree castaways on a desert shore find an Arabian Nights city, where they compete for the luscious Princess Shalmar.", "popularity": 5.735, "poster_path": "/nECM25OC4iJHV1AHPa4CHnzYgyk.jpg", "release_date": "1942-11-10", "title": "Road to Morocco", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.9, "vote_count": 48}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/yBcMUlGTxJMSzdZsqShNscqnIzV.jpg", "genre_ids": [28, 36, 12, 18], "id": 167449, "original_language": "cn", "original_title": "\u8840\u6ef4\u5b50", "overview": "In the time of the Qing Dynasty, the Emperor Yongzheng created a secret army known as the Guillotines.
