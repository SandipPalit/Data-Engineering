# IPL Analysis

I have implemented the following operations using Spark RDD, Spark Dataframe, and Spark SQL:
* Counting the number of matches played in each city.
* Counting the number of matches won by each team in 2014.
* Finding the Player who won the most MOM award.
* Find the top 10 umpires who was present in most of the matches.
* Count of teams who won the Match after winning the Toss.
